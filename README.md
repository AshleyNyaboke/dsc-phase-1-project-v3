Aviation Accident Analysis Project

Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of aviation accident data to identify patterns, assess risks, and offer evidence-based recommendations to improve aviation safety. The main deliverables include:

A cleaned and well-documented Jupyter Notebook.

An  Tableau Dashboard png .

A final presentation for stakeholders.

The original and cleaned datasets.


Project Objectives
Understand trends and factors associated with aviation accidents.

Analyze aircraft types, phases of flight, and accident severity.

Provide actionable insights and safety recommendations based on historical data.


Business Understanding
Aviation accidents can have devastating consequences. Understanding the factors behind them can help business stakeholders and aviation authorities:

Minimize operational risks.

Choose safer aircraft types.

Allocate safety resources effectively.

 
Data Summary
Original Dataset: Included raw aviation accident records with missing values and inconsistent formatting.

Cleaned Dataset: Preprocessed data with cleaned column names, removed nulls, and transformed fields for accurate analysis.

Key Insights
Certain aircraft types consistently show higher accident rates.

Landing and takeoff are the most accident-prone phases of flight.

Fatality rates vary significantly depending on aircraft class and purpose of flight.

You can explore these insights interactively in the Tableau Dashboard provided.

ðŸ“‹ Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) â€“ Data cleaning and visualization

Jupyter Notebook â€“ Code and analysis documentation

Tableau â€“ Dashboard for visual storytelling

Git & GitHub â€“ Version control and collaboration

Open (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ashley.nyaboke/viz/PROJECTDASHBOARD_17535159092710/AviationAccidentsinsights?publish=yes) in Tableau to explore the visual dashboard.

Recommendations
Prefer certain aircraft types with historically low accident rates for commercial operations.

Allocate additional training and safety checks during takeoff and landing.

Further investigate trends in recent years as aviation technology evolves.

Next Steps
Expand analysis with newer datasets from 2024â€“2025.

Incorporate machine learning models to predict accident likelihood.

Collaborate with aviation experts for deeper risk analysis.
